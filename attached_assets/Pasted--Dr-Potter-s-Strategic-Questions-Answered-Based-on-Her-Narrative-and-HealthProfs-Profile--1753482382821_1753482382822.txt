# Dr. Potter's Strategic Questions - Answered
## Based on Her Narrative and HealthProfs Profile

### SECTION 1: NATURE OF CARE & PHILOSOPHY

**1. What does "walking alongside people on their health journey" actually look like in practice?**
It means I don't just diagnose and treat - I empower, encourage, and equip people to live healthier lives. I journey with my patients through their ups and downs, celebrating improvements in sleep and energy, and providing support when they face setbacks. This looks like spending a full hour with new patients, being available for questions between visits, and adjusting treatment plans as we learn what works best for each individual.

**2. When you say "layers within them heal," what are these layers specifically?**
I address four interconnected layers: physical (digestion, hormones, environmental exposures), mental/emotional (anxiety, depression, trauma responses), spiritual (finding meaning and connection), and energetic (nervous system regulation through LENS neurofeedback). True healing happens when we support all these aspects together, not just treat symptoms.

**3. What does "becoming more of who they are" mean in the context of health and healing?**
When people's basic needs are met - good sleep, steady energy, healthy digestion - they can show up as their authentic selves. Chronic health issues often mask our true personalities and potential. As these improve, patients rediscover their vitality, creativity, and capacity for joy that may have been buried under symptoms.

**4. How do you define "optimal wellness" differently than other practitioners?**
GROW: Gaining Resources for Optimal Wellness. It's not just the absence of disease, but having the energy, clarity, and resilience to pursue what matters most to you. It's when your body systems work harmoniously so you can focus on living your purpose rather than managing symptoms.

**5. What is your personal story that led you to this integrative approach?**
After working in a thriving integrative primary care clinic alongside nurse practitioners, an osteopathic doctor, chiropractor, and acupuncturist, I saw firsthand how powerful collaborative, whole-person care could be. I realized that combining my nutritional science background with naturopathic training and specialized skills like LENS neurofeedback could offer patients something truly unique.

### SECTION 2: MARKET DIFFERENTIATION

**6. Why do you combine LENS Neurofeedback with naturopathic medicine specifically?**
Many naturopaths focus primarily on physical symptoms, while neurofeedback practitioners often miss the foundational physical imbalances. I address both simultaneously - supporting the nervous system through LENS while also correcting nutritional deficiencies, hormone imbalances, and digestive issues that affect brain function. This creates faster, more lasting results.

**7. How do you determine which treatment modalities to use for each patient?**
I look at the whole picture during our comprehensive intake. If someone has gut issues affecting their mood, we start with digestive support and botanicals. If trauma or stress is driving physical symptoms, we might prioritize LENS neurofeedback. My 12 years of experience and diverse training help me see patterns and choose the most effective combination for each person.

**8. What role does the patient play in their own healing process?**
Patients are active partners, not passive recipients. I equip them with knowledge about their condition, teach them to recognize their body's signals, and provide tools they can use at home. True empowerment comes when patients understand why we're using specific treatments and how their choices support or hinder their healing.

**9. What can patients expect from you that they can't get elsewhere?**
- **From traditional naturopaths:** Advanced neurofeedback training and trauma release exercises
- **From conventional doctors:** Time, comprehensive assessment, and natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals
- **From other integrative practitioners:** Specialized training in natural foot care and my unique combination of nutritional science background with naturopathic training
- **From mental health counselors:** Physical support for the body systems that affect mental/emotional health

**10. What specific results do your patients typically experience?**
Patients consistently report improved sleep quality, increased energy levels, better digestion, and enhanced emotional resilience. Many see reductions in anxiety and depression symptoms, improved focus (especially with ADHD), and better stress management. Those with autoimmune conditions often experience fewer flares and improved quality of life.

**11. What's your success rate with conditions you commonly treat?**
My specialties - digestive problems, hormonal issues, autoimmune diseases, and mental health concerns - typically show significant improvement within 3-6 months when patients follow the treatment plan. I have particular success with complex cases that haven't responded well to conventional treatment alone.

**12. How long have you been practicing, and what's your track record?**
I've been in practice for 12 years since graduating from National College of Natural Medicine in 2012. My diverse background includes nutritional science from UC Berkeley and biblical studies, giving me a unique perspective on whole-person wellness.

### SECTION 3: PATIENT EXPERIENCE & TREATMENT APPROACH

**13. What is your specific process for "thorough" care?**
My new patient visits last a full hour and include comprehensive intake forms covering medical history, lifestyle factors, stress levels, sleep patterns, digestive function, and environmental exposures. I perform physical examinations and order specialized testing like food sensitivity panels, hormone assessments, and environmental toxin screens that most doctors don't utilize.

**14. How do you use physical exams, lab work, AND neurofeedback together?**
I start with comprehensive physical assessment and targeted lab work to identify underlying imbalances. Then I use LENS neurofeedback to help the nervous system integrate these changes and respond better to physical treatments. For example, if someone has digestive issues partly driven by stress, neurofeedback helps their nervous system regulate while botanical medicines heal the gut.

**15. What types of cases do you excel with that other practitioners struggle with?**
Complex, multi-system cases where mental/emotional and physical symptoms are intertwined. Patients who've "tried everything" often haven't addressed the nervous system component. I also excel with children and teenagers because my approach addresses the whole family system, not just the individual.

**16. What happens in that crucial first hour?**
We explore not just what's wrong, but what's right - your strengths, resources, and healing capacity. I listen to your story, help you understand the connections between your symptoms, and begin mapping out a personalized treatment plan. You leave with hope, understanding, and clear next steps.

**17. How do you help patients understand complex conditions?**
I use simple analogies and visual explanations. For instance, I might compare adrenal fatigue to a car running on empty, or explain how gut health affects mood like a "second brain." I provide written summaries and resources so patients can review and share with family members.

**18. What does "empowered and educated" look like for your patients?**
Patients understand their condition, can explain it to others, know what to expect from treatment, and have tools to manage symptoms at home. They make informed decisions about their care and feel confident advocating for their health needs.

**19. How do you support patients between appointments?**
I'm available for questions via the patient portal or phone calls. I provide written treatment plans, educational materials, and sometimes recommend books or online resources. For complex cases, I might check in via email between appointments.

### SECTION 4: TREATMENT-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS

**20. For LENS Neurofeedback specifically:**
- **Best results:** ADHD, anxiety, depression, PTSD, TBI, sleep disorders, and emotional regulation issues
- **My approach difference:** I combine it with naturopathic support for optimal nervous system function
- **Patient experience:** Most feel more relaxed during sessions, with cumulative improvements in sleep, focus, and emotional resilience over 10-20 sessions

**21. For naturopathic treatments:**
- **Prescribing philosophy:** I prefer whole plant medicines and targeted nutrition, using supplements strategically to fill specific gaps
- **Homeopathy personalization:** Based on constitutional assessment and individual symptom patterns
- **Nutrition role:** Foundation of all treatment - we can't heal on a poor diet, and food can be medicine

**22. What types of patients seek you out?**
Parents of children with ADHD, anxiety, or behavioral issues; adults with chronic digestive problems, hormone imbalances, or autoimmune conditions; people who want natural alternatives to medications; those who feel unheard by conventional medicine; patients dealing with stress-related health issues.

**23. What conditions do you have the most success treating?**
My top specialties: digestive disorders, adrenal fatigue, autoimmune diseases, emotional wellbeing issues, ADHD, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, thyroid problems, and women's health issues.

**24. What types of patients are NOT a good fit?**
Those expecting quick fixes or unwilling to make lifestyle changes; patients needing emergency care or primary care services; those not open to natural approaches or patient education; individuals not ready to take an active role in their healing.

**25. Timeline for seeing results?**
Most patients notice initial improvements in energy or sleep within 2-4 weeks. Significant changes typically occur at 2-3 months, with optimal results at 6-12 months for complex chronic conditions.

- Specialized training in LENS neurofeedback, trauma release exercises, and natural foot care with Ray McClanahan, DPM

**27. Continuing education:**
Regular training in botanical medicine, neurofeedback techniques, and trauma-informed care. I stay current with research in integrative medicine and attend conferences to learn new approaches.

**28. Professional affiliations:**
Licensed naturopathic physician in Oregon (License #1959), verified by HealthProfs.com. I collaborate with other integrative practitioners and maintain relationships with conventional providers for appropriate referrals.

**29. Collaboration with other providers:**
I work closely with other healthcare providers when needed, including medical doctors for medication management, specialists for complex cases, and other integrative practitioners for complementary therapies.

### SECTION 6: PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

**30. Patient success stories:**
A teenager with severe ADHD and anxiety who couldn't focus in school now thrives academically after LENS neurofeedback and nutritional support. A woman with decades of digestive issues and depression found relief through targeted botanicals and gut healing protocols combined with neurofeedback for stress management.

**31. Common patient feedback:**
"Dr. Potter really listens and understands the whole picture." "I finally have energy again." "She helped me understand my body for the first time." "My child is like a different person - calmer and happier."

**32. How I measure success:**
Improved sleep quality, increased energy, better digestion, reduced anxiety/depression scores, improved focus and concentration, fewer sick days, better stress management, and most importantly - patients feeling like themselves again.

**33. Insurance philosophy:**
I accept several insurance plans to make care accessible, but I don't let insurance dictate treatment length or methods. I believe in spending adequate time with patients and using the most appropriate treatments, not just what insurance prefers.

**34. Making care accessible:**
I offer payment plans for those who need them and try to work within families' budgets. I also provide education and resources that patients can use at home to extend the value of their visits.

**35. Appointment philosophy:**
Quality over quantity. An hour for new patients and 30-45 minutes for follow-ups allows for thorough assessment and meaningful therapeutic relationships. Rushing through appointments serves no one well.

### SECTION 7: CONTENT & MESSAGING

**36. What patients should understand about integrative medicine:**
It's not anti-conventional medicine - it's about using the best of all approaches. Natural doesn't always mean slow or gentle; sometimes natural treatments work faster than pharmaceuticals. The goal is supporting your body's innate healing capacity.

**37. Common misconceptions:**
That naturopathic medicine is "just vitamins and herbs" - we're trained as primary care doctors with additional natural medicine expertise. That neurofeedback is experimental - it's been used safely for decades with extensive research support.

**38. Specialized vs. primary care:**
I focus on complex chronic conditions rather than acute illnesses, routine checkups, or urgent care needs. This allows me to dedicate time and expertise to cases that benefit most from integrative approaches.

**39. Most frequent questions during consultations:**
"How long will it take to feel better?" "Will this interfere with my medications?" "Is this safe for children?" "Why haven't other doctors suggested this?" "What can I do at home to help?"

**40. Common concerns preventing scheduling:**
Cost and insurance coverage, time commitment, skepticism about natural medicine, fear of being judged for previous treatment failures, uncertainty about whether I can help their specific condition.

**41. 30-second elevator pitch:**
"I help children and adults with complex health issues find lasting solutions through personalized naturopathic care and neurofeedback. My patients regain their energy, improve their mood, and feel like themselves again by addressing root causes, not just symptoms."

**42. Most important thing before first visit:**
I'm here to partner with you in your healing journey. Bring your questions, your hopes, and your willingness to try a different approach. Together, we'll help you GROW toward optimal wellness.

**43. Consultation vs. new patient visit:**
Free consultations are for people unsure if my approach fits their needs or who want to understand my philosophy. New patient visits are for those ready to begin treatment and undergo comprehensive assessment.

**44. Questions to determine fit:**
"Are you willing to make lifestyle changes?" "Do you prefer understanding the 'why' behind treatments?" "Are you looking for natural alternatives or additions to conventional care?" "Do you want a doctor who spends time with you?"

**45. Preparation for first visit:**
Complete intake forms thoroughly, bring current supplements and medications, list all previous treatments tried, prepare questions about your health goals, and come with an open mind about addressing multiple aspects of your health simultaneously.
